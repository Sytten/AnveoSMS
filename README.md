AnveoSMS is a small program to receive your SMS from [Anveo](http://www.anveo.com) and forward them to an email address of your choice. [Anveo](http://www.anveo.com) is a great provider is you need a phone number to receive 2FA since it supports **short codes**. If you are willing to pay for a premium plan, [Anveo](http://www.anveo.com) does offer the same feature but if you are a thinkerer like me I invite you to use this application!

## ‚úÖ Current features

- Receive SMS from [Anveo](http://www.anveo.com)
- Send them to any email using [Sengrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
- Deployment infrastructure on GCP

## üèóÔ∏è How to deploy?

- The suggested way of deploying it is using the provided `Infrastructure as Code` in the [infra](https://github.com/Sytten/AnveoSMS/tree/main/infra) folder. This will deploy it on GCP Cloud Run which is very cheap. As I build more and more features, I plan to rely heavily on GCP features so this will eventually be the only way of deploying.
- If you want to host it yourself, you can use the [Docker images](https://github.com/Sytten/AnveoSMS/packages/445142) I build for every release. See the configuration setup in the [app](https://github.com/Sytten/AnveoSMS/tree/main/app) folder.

## üí° Ideas for future features

- Store them in a database
- An API for access
- Web portal
- Mobile application
