AnveoSMS is a small program to receive your SMS from [Anveo](http://www.anveo.com) and forward them to an email address of your choice. [Anveo](http://www.anveo.com) is a great provider is you need a phone number to receive 2FA since it supports **short codes**. If you are willing to pay for a premium plan, [Anveo](http://www.anveo.com) does offer the same feature but if you are a thinkerer like me I invite you to use this application!

## âœ… Current features
