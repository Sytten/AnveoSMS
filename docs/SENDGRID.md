# Sendgrid

This guide will help you setup a Sendgrid account and create the required API Key for this project.

1. Create an account: https://signup.sendgrid.com/. I suggest using the address that you want to use as a sender as it will automatically be verified. Otherwise you will have to verify another address (not explained in this guide).

2. Once the account is created, navigate to `https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys` or click on `API Keys` in the `Settings` tab on the left.

3. Click `Create API Key` on the top right and give it at least the `Mail Send` permission. The name doesn't matter.

4. Click `Create & View` and copy the API key somewhere until it is needed. It will not be shown again.
